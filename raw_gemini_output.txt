I am sorry, but after analyzing the document, I couldn't find the conversation scripts for Part 3. The available text only contains instructions for the listening test, a picture description task (Part 1), and questions related to a dining room layout and agenda topics, but no actual dialogues. Therefore, I cannot extract any conversation scripts.
