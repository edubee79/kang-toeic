Book1,Test01,P7_010,Article+Email,Food Truck Web Site Design,"Article: Tips for designing a Web site for a food-truck business

Owners of food trucks move from place to place within and between cities as they carry out their business so they often rely on word of mouth or social media to attract customers. As a result they may not build a Web site of their own. But in fact by the very nature of their business it is crucial that food truck owners have a fixed place for the public to learn about them order from them contact them etc. Furthermore market research shows that a Web site can help build a loyal customer base. So here are some tips for developing a great Web site for your food truck.

The Home page should have bold graphics with your food truck's name. The text must prominently display key information such as your truck's locations and operating hours. Online forms with fields to fill out such as reservation requests for special events or services give new visitors too much visual information. They are better incorporated as links or pop-up windows.

The Food Menu page needs attractive high-definition images along with vivid and precise text that describes each menu item in detail. Remember that your photos should be big enough to look appealing on larger computer monitors.

The About Us page should include some text explaining your food truck's theme and concept and some biographical data detailing your background in the food industry.

The News page can include text informing visitors about seasonal food items and upcoming promotions or special events such as food festivals.

Subject: Drilling notice

Dear Mr. Green:

As a courtesy I am writing to you at the Red Hills Business Association asking you to help me get the word out to your membership. It was announced in last month's Daily Gazette that Rilamore University is moving forward with its Net Zero Initiative. Within three years we expect to have geothermal wells installed and operational for the heating and cooling of our entire campus. Limiting the institution's reliance on fossil fuels has long been a goal and the new system is a significant step toward achieving that goal.

Over the next month we will conduct test drilling in several campus locations. If all goes according to schedule the crew will be drilling adjacent to the Red Hills Business District and Oak Street Apartments starting Wednesday June 5. We want to tell business owners and residents near the campus to expect a higher-than-usual noise level during the two weeks we estimate it will take to complete the work. The work hours for the drilling crew are 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. each day Monday through Friday.

We apologize in advance for the inconvenience this may cause to our neighbors. Any questions or concerns should be directed to me at 813-555-0123.

Review:
I left a description of my problem with Lawai Home Service and one of the company's estimators came to inspect my roof the very next day. After I decided to replace the roof the Lawai Home Service crew was able to get to work the following week. Diana Perez was on-site for the whole job as promised and answered all my questions. Work was started on December 19 and it was finished on December 20. Once the roofing was finished the crew did a great job cleaning up. They used two magnetic devices resembling lawnmowers and swept over my entire lawn to find any dropped roofing nails. I had never seen anything like that! I was very pleased with the thoroughness of their work.

Hello Ms. Pereira,

I have shipped some sample notebook covers for your inspection. Unfortunately I was not able to include one of the designs for your approval because it needed a late-stage change to the background color. The sticker art did not show up well against the original black background. We are testing a light-beige color and I will send the updated sample cover to you after it has been approved internally.

I should have the last sample to you by the end of this week. As long as you send your approval of all covers by June 11 we will be able to ship your entire order of bound notebooks before July 20. You will have everything before your sale that begins on August 1. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Subject: Employee of the month

Dear Managers,

It is time to vote for the Wilson Autos Employee of the Month for September. Here are the nominees.

Erica Boyd has been with us for only a few months but has already shown great promise and is eager to learn new things.

Lauren Almahdi is very proactive. If something needs to be done she will point it out to a manager and volunteer to take care of it herself.

Nick Salehi found a glitch in our computer system and stopped us from incorrectly ordering unnecessary inventory (thus saving us money).

Max Rhodes has been especially helpful with training new hires. He is calm and patient and explains our procedures well.

Please respond to this e-mail by Friday with your vote. The winner must receive at least three votes. The winner will be posted at our front desk and on our Web site next Monday.

Thanks,
Charlotte Black

Review:
Wilson Autos (Westchester)
My wife and I just bought a new Excelera truck at the Wilson Autos Westchester location with the help of Erica Boyd. Even though she was new she was very knowledgeable about all the trucks on the lot that we wanted to test drive. The few questions she was unable to answer were quickly addressed by her mentor Max. We were very pleased with the customer service and even more delighted when the general manager agreed to sell us the Excelera for the same price that a competing dealership was advertising. I highly recommend Wilson Autos if you are in the market for a new vehicle!

The employee of the month for September is ERICA BOYD!

In her three months at Wilson Autos Erica has picked up new skills quickly and is always trying to learn more. She has become very knowledgeable about our inventory and is able to share her knowledge with customers to complete sales. She has also been instrumental in encouraging satisfied customers to post comments on our social media pages.
