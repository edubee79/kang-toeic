Many people suggested improving our ability to create more-attractive slide presentations. I agree this'll be useful when you meet with prospective clients, so I'd like to accommodate that request with an on-site training. A sign-up sheet has been posted in the employee break room. Just a heads-up that we have a limited number of computers available."
