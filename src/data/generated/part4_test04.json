Last summer, when the weather was unusually hot, we decided to design suits that would be comfortable to wear when it's hot outside. People who wear these suits remain cool, regardless of the temperature. Now, these suits have become so popular that we cannot keep up with the demand. With your investment, we'll be able to purchase some advanced machinery that would allow us to triple our production."

An online organization like ours relies heavily on the support of its design and technical staff. Today I'd like to discuss adding a section to the site that features our most popular news stories. Many other news sites already have a popular stories section. I'm concerned that we're not keeping up with them, and it could affect our readership. Now, I realize you're all busy, but I don't think this will involve too much work. Plus, remember, we have technology interns starting next week."
