So, I just wanted to get your approval for this new price before I put in the order. And 73I recommend that we order soon, since the rainy season's only a month away. Once the rain starts, it'll take more time to install the new roof."

When customers call the service number, they'll be prompted to say which department they're trying to reach, and then voice-recognition software will direct their call automatically. I'm sure most of you have experiences of your own calling customer-service hotlines that utilize this kind of system. Usually, it works, but it can be frustrating when it doesn't. 90,91 Some customers might be upset with you if they were unable to reach the right department quickly. If this happens to you, please summarize the exchange in writing. I'll give the feedback to the programmers so they can make improvements to the program accordingly."

Well, as you know, if a machine in an assembly line malfunctions, it can trigger significant downtime. Pondrew's software continuously gathers and processes data from each machine, so issues can be diagnosed faster. Yes, 94 there are other software programs on the market that perform similar tasks, but they're complicated and require hours of training. Consider this about Pondrew's: the manual's just fifteen pages long."
