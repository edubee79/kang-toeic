Today, I'll be sharing a few tips that'll make that process easier. First, consider where you're going to put the carpet. For example, if you're carpeting a children's playroom, you probably don't want to select a wool carpet, since they're difficult to clean. Second, we recommend making sure your carpet is protected under our warranty in case of damage. At Logan's Flooring, we provide one-year warranties on all our carpets! Be sure to subscribe to this video channel for free weekly tips and ideas."

But I suggest the one between Dogwood Pond and the children's playground. It offers fantastic views of our city's skyline. Finally, for any gardeners among us, the Oakfield Parks Department needs volunteers to help care for the community garden. If you're interested, please visit the city government Web site."

With that goal, I'd like to schedule our first nutrition class at a time that's available to as many people as possible, so I'm asking that you complete this short survey. I do have some flexibility in the afternoons so I could move the afternoon session during the week to a later time if necessary. The weekend session cannot be moved."
