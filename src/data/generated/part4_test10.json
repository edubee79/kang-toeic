As you know, 89despite our strategy of positioning ourselves as a seller of high-quality furniture, 90we've been losing business to several secondhand stores selling used furniture in the area. There's one thing that we can start doing that many other furniture stores aren't: offering free assembly. By developing cross-functional delivery teams, we'll be able to gain a competitive edge. So 91next month, all of our delivery teams will attend sessions where they'll learn how to assemble our products in customers' homes."

My department has received reports of delays averaging an hour at peak periods. 93It has become clear that the ongoing track and wire repair work has become far too disruptive for city commuters. 94With this week's unacceptable delays in mind, my department, the city transportation office, is negotiating with the contractor, National Rail. That's the company that owns the tracks and runs the trains for Sommerville. To be clear, the tracks and trains are not city property. OK, now I can take some questions."

As I'm sure you're aware, 100we've missed our production targets for the last two quarters. That means we're spending too much time assembling our products. As you can see on this chart, 99the data show that one of our machines is running a very slow production cycle at an average of six minutes, twenty-two seconds per cycle. We've already flagged it for repair by a technician. By next week, that machine should be at normal output. 100We're very optimistic about the impact the new analytic software will have on next quarter's targets."
